# NLP-Resume-Screening-Project

INTRODUCTION:

Resume screening is the process of determining whether a candidate is qualified for a role based on his or her education, experience, and other information captured on their resume.
It’s a form of pattern matching between a job’s requirements and the qualifications of a candidate based on their resume.
The goal of screening resumes is to decide whether to move a candidate forward – usually onto an interview – or to reject them.

Modules & Libraries Description:

Libraries :-
NumPy
- NumPy is one of the fundamental packages for Python providing support for large multidimensional arrays and matrices
Pandas
- It is an open-source, Python library. Pandas enable the provision of easy data structure and quicker data analysis for Python. For operations like data analysis and modelling,
Matplotlib
- This open-source library in Python is widely used for publication of quality figures in a variety of hard copy formats and interactive environments across platforms. You can design charts, graphs, pie charts, scatterplots, histograms, error charts, etc. with just a few lines of code.
Seaborn
- When it comes to visualisation of statistical models like heat maps, Seaborn is among the reliable sources. This Python library is derived from Matplotlib and closely integrated with Pandas data structures.
Scipy
- This is yet another open-source software used for scientific computing in Python. Apart from that, Scipy is also used for Data Computation, productivity, and high- performance computing and quality assurance.
Scikit-learn
- It is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language and can be effectively used for a variety of applications which include classification, regression, clustering, model selection, naive Bayes’, grade boosting, K-means, and preprocessing.
Nltk
- Natural Language toolkit or NLTK is said to be one among the popular Python NLP Libraries. It contains a set of processing libraries that provide processing solutions for numerical and symbolic language processing in English only.
